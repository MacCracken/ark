## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- Core `ArkPackageManager` engine with `ArkConfig` configuration
- CLI argument parser (`parse_args`) supporting install, remove, search, list, info, update, upgrade, and status commands
- Plan-based execution model: `InstallPlan` with `InstallStep` variants for system (apt), marketplace, and Flutter sources
- Package group installation via `--group` flag (desktop, ai/ml, shell, edge/iot)
- `TransactionLog` with JSONL append-only persistence for crash recovery and audit
- Transaction lifecycle: begin, add_op, mark_op_complete, mark_op_failed, commit, rollback, fail
- `PackageDb` unified package registry with file tracking, ownership queries, and integrity checking
- Topological dependency resolution via `resolve_install_order`
- SHA-256 integrity verification infrastructure
- `ArkOutput` structured output formatting with Header, Package, Info, Separator, Success, Error, Warning lines
- `#[non_exhaustive]` on all public enums for forward compatibility
- `#[must_use]` on all pure functions
- Serde roundtrip tests for all public types
- Criterion benchmarks for parse_args, serde, PackageDb, TransactionLog, format_plan, and output display
- `scripts/bench-history.sh` for benchmark tracking

### Notes

- Ark generates execution plans but does not execute them directly (security by design)
- Dependency resolution is delegated to `nous` -- ark never reimplements it
- 82 tests, 0 failures, 2 ignored (pending nous alignment)
